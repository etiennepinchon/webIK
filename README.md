# [WIP/Not working] WebIK - An inverse kinematics for WebVR with support for 3Ô∏è‚É£ThreeJs and üÖ∞Ô∏èA-Frame.

WIP of an inverse kinematics for WebVR to create full body avatars. Port from VRIK (Unity C#) part of the FinalIK asset.
The code has been ported to javascript but still need to be fully debugged. Also it is not working correcty. Also note that Unity is using left handed rotation but ThreeJS is using right handed rotation and this has not been adapted yet.

## Want to make some changes to it?

Please do! Together we can bring full body avatars to the web!

### Original c# source

Original c# source files from VRIK can be found in the c_sharp_source folder.
Note that this is not the full FinalIK project, only the VR part. I do not own the right on the C# files, they are only here to help us porting the code to the web.
